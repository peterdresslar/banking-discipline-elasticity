# ### Banking Discipline and Elasticity
# J M Applegate  
# ##### CAS543 Complexity Economics
# The notebook presents basic banking discipline and elasticity dynamics.  
# A set of $n$ of retail customers are served by $N$ banks.  
# Banks hold reserves as a central bank according to a specified reserve requirement.  
# Customer transactions take place every day, and every night the reserve accounts need to be non-negative.  
# Surplus banks lend to deficit banks as requested to meet the overnight non-negative reserve requirement.
