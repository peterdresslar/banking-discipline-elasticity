# ### Banking Discipline and Elasticity
# J M Applegate.
# ##### CAS543 Complexity Economics
# The notebook presents basic banking discipline and elasticity dynamics.  
# A set of $n$ of retail customers are served by $N$ banks.  
# Banks hold reserves as a central bank according to a specified reserve requirement.  
# Customer transactions take place every day, and every night the reserve accounts need to be non-negative.  
# Surplus banks lend to deficit banks as requested to meet the overnight non-negative reserve requirement.

# Updates: We have added a risk assessment and pricing component to the intrabank lending model. `update_net_positions` updates a risk assessment factor for each bank based on how they are positioned with respect to their reserve requirements. `get_lender_quote` is called for every lender to obtain a priced proposition for a loan to the bank in question based on the risk assessment.
